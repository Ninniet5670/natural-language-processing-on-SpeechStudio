My recent experience at Hotel Maresia was, unfortunately, a complete letdown. The name "Maresia" promises a refreshing sea breeze and a beachside experience, but what we found was far from that idyllic image.
Firstly, upon arrival, we were greeted by an uninterested and unwelcoming reception staff. They seemed more engrossed in personal conversations among themselves than ensuring a pleasant experience for guests. There was no orientation about the hotel facilities or available services.
